# C-Programs
Hey.. for C++ Program we need C++ Compiler and C++ Code Editor Application 
for Compiler link
// MinGW 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
MinGW is a complete GCC toolchain (including half a dozen frontends, such as C, C++, Ada, Go, and whatnot) for the Windows platform which compiles for and links to the Windows OS component C Runtime Library in msvcrt.dll. Rather it tries to be minimal (hence the name).
This means, unlike Cygwin, MinGW does not attempt to offer a complete POSIX layer on top of Windows, but on the other hand it does not require you to link with a special compatibility library
